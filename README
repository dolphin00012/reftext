# README
This vscode-extension is for coloring parts of one's own plain text file omitting eventually stored
formatting intact. Rotative using "Markdown language" (integrated by default in vscode) it's possible
to use folding and re-arrange big note-groups in a file. The coloring of reftext-exstension is for
decipherering "personal notes" versus literatur reference text.
